challenge: "With the recent changes to the hospitality industry  due to Covid, 2Taps WineBar approached us to improve their website and provide their customers a place to view their menus online.

If you decide to change something that maybe is not selling well or have run out of a certain item, you can just take it off the menu straight away. Saving time and printing costs. Great for marketing your business, updating your website, adding new items and offers, pushing best sellers.
